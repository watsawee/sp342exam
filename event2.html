                    <p> Lalisa Manobal (also spelled Manoban; born Pranpriya Manobal;[b] March 27, 1997), known
                        mononymously as Lisa (Korean: 리사), is a Thai rapper, singer, dancer, and actress. She is a
                        member of the South Korean girl group Blackpink, which debuted under YG Entertainment in August
                        2016. She is set to make her acting debut in 2025 in the HBO television series The White Lotus.
                        Lisa made her solo music debut with her single album Lalisa in September 2021, which made her
                        the first female artist to sell 736,000 copies of an album in its first week in South Korea. The
                        music video for its lead single of the same name broke the record for the most-viewed music
                        video in the first 24 hours on YouTube by a solo artist. Both "Lalisa" and the album's viral
                        second single "Money" charted in the top ten of the Billboard Global 200, the latter becoming
                        the longest-charting song by a female K-pop soloist on the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK
                        Singles Chart.</p>
