  <h5>The Future Nostalgia Tour was the second concert tour by English and Albanian singer Dua Lipa, in support of her second studio album, Future Nostalgia (2020). It began on 9 February 2022 at the FTX Arena in Miami and ended on 28 November of the same year at Tirana's Skanderbeg Square. The tour visited cities across North America, Europe, Latin America and Oceania.

    The tour was divided into four sections and an encore. It was produced by creative studio Ceremony London, promoted by Live Nation and sponsored by Truly Hard Seltzer. Lipa wore custom outfits by Balenciaga, Marine Serre, John Galliano and Mugler during the show. The Future Nostalgia Tour was met with highly positive reviews from critics, who praised Lipa's stage presence, vocals and the pace of the show. It also experienced commercial success; on the 2022 Billboard year-end boxscore chart, it was ranked the world's 18th highest-grossing tour of the year, grossing $89,302,575 from 71 shows.
    
    The first European dates of the Future Nostalgia Tour were announced in December 2019, and were scheduled to take place from April to June of the following year. These shows were postponed several times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lipa announced North American and Oceanian dates in September 2021, as well as extra European dates and Latin American dates in November and December respectively. She announced the final show of the tour would take place in Tirana in November 2022, commemorating the 110th anniversary of Albanian independence.</h5  >
