            <p>The Justice World Tour was the fourth concert tour by Canadian singer Justin Bieber. The tour was in
              support of his fifth and sixth studio albums, Changes (2020) and Justice (2021).
              Promoted by T-Mobile, the tour was originally set to begin on May 14, 2020, in Seattle and to conclude on
              September 26, 2020, in East Rutherford, New Jersey. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all of the
              original planned dates were postponed to 2021, and later to 2022. The tour officially began on February
              18, 2022, in San Diego and was scheduled to end on March 25, 2023, in Krak√≥w. However, the tour ended in
              Rio de Janeiro on September 4, 2022, due to Bieber prioritizing his health, after 49 shows in three
              continents, with the remaining shows being cancelled in February 2023.
              The remainder of tour dates were cancelled in late 2022 after Bieber was diagnosed with Type 2 Ramsay Hunt
              syndrome.</p>
