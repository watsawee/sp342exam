  "Surely, there is no perfect death in this world, these words don't seem logical together, but that's what makes this message even more powerful and painful, because there are countless unjust deaths happening. The song was written from the perspective of a mother watching her child being killed just because of racial conflict that sees the lives of people of color as meaningless. Even though we all know that every innocent life should not be sacrificed by culture and violence of the police," said Alicia Keys.

  From the events of the protests that arose from the use of police violence that led to the death of a black man, which has been continuously happening just because of the belief in racial prejudice, Alicia, a talented singer-songwriter who has won a total of 15 Grammy Awards, not only aims to be another voice demanding justice, but also brings these feelings together to compose a powerful ballad that will remain in everyone's memory, titled "Perfect Way to Die". The song is written to narrate the story of the innocent lives lost like Michael Brown and Sandra Bland, whose deaths sparked protests against injustice. Although these issues still persist today, the violence that has occurred is beginning to be widely recognized.
  
  "Perfect Way To Die", written by Alicia and Sebastian Kole, tells the story of a woman who received the news that her son had been shot and killed, leaving her heartbroken.
  
  Alicia will perform "Perfect Way To Die" at the BET Awards on June 28. "Perfect Way To Die" will be one of the singles from her fourth album titled "ALICIA", set to be released this autumn under RCA Records.
